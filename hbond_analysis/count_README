First you need to define residues gmx_make ndx for up and down state chain A and chain B and v+ and v-

THen you can use 

echo 24 25 | gmx hbond -f v+center10ns.xtc -s topol.tpr -n hbond-y175-t278.ndx -num

Then you need to count how many 1 and 0 in the column for that numpy script (ilki eski) Ikinciyi kullan toplu replica analizi yapiyor;
